# Docker
Here there are all the tests I've done for docker.
The tests that have been useful have been uploaded in the main repository
[DockerTools](https://github.com/MarcoDiFrancesco/DockerTools).

## Docker commands
`docker image build -t bulletinboard:1.0 /dir`
`docker container run --publish 8000:8080 --detach --name testBuild test:1.0`
